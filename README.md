# CardsAndMonsters

I was curious how much work it would take to build my own card game so this is it! First attempting an MVP with a familiar language before rebuilding in C++ so that I can focus more on getting stuck in rather than dealing with memory allocation and other headaches I don't want to deal with quite yet. I think this will be a good learning experience, both because I've already found it really fun to plan out the rules for my own game (shamelessly stolen from other similar card games for now as this is just a learner project but I am planning on adding special rules as and when I find a good original one and who knows, maybe this will join the many shelves of Steam indie games gathering dust one day) and because, despite it being just a card game, there's a good few complex subjects I should be able to cover. Initial plan is to get a simple one-sided game going with the various rules I've picked for an MVP (mainly limits on how many cards can be played per turn, how the game ends, types of cards etc), then look at implementing an AI (in C# for now) to take over the opponents role. Hoping I can remember to keep up with this blog too but I suppose I'll add a reminder on my TODO...

Merry Christmas! Had some time to spare after a lovely day with the partner, so focused on switching the positions of cards. In this game, cards can be played face up/down and also horizontally/vertically which also is restricted based on the type of card. Managed to add the functionality but introduced a new bug that stops more than one monster card being played (always nice) so that'll be my next focus. Learned a lot more about how the equality comparer works (value equality vs reference equality) and so removed a redundant interface I implemented for the player class. The code is starting to get a little hard to follow (being tired doesn't help) but I'm going to crack on for now before I look at a refactor, took me longer than expected to get this feature added and I'm going to have to add spell and trap cards before I've got all the pieces I need to be able to look at the full game properly. Once I've fixed any bugs that are still hanging around I also need to look at the more advanced logic for attacking then I can see where to go from there. It's possible I'll stick with C# long term for the project, as I was unaware Unity allowed you to use that as well as C++. We'll see what happens though, in the meantime I think an early night is in order...
