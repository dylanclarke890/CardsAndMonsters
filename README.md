I was curious how much work it would take to build my own card game so this is it! First attempting an MVP with a familiar language before rebuilding in C++ so that I can focus more on getting stuck in the dealing with memory allocation and other headaches I don't want to deal with quite yet. I think this will be a good learning experience, both because I've already found it really fun to plan out the rules for my own game (shamelessly stolen from other similar card games for now as this is just a learner project but I am planning on adding special rules as and when I find a good original one and who knows, maybe this will join the many shelves of Steam indie games gathering dust one day) and because, despite it being just a card game, there's a good few complex subjects I should be able to cover. Initial plan is to get a simple one-sided game going with the various rules I've picked for an MVP (mainly limits on how many cards can be played per turn, how the game ends, types of cards etc), then look at implementing an AI (in C# for now) to take over the opponents role. Hoping I can remember to keep up with this blog too but I suppose I'll add a reminder on my TODO...
